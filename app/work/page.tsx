        I began my journey with <a href="https://www.sliceit.com/">slice</a> as an intern in January 2022 and transitioned to a full-time software developer in July 2022. My initial role was with the core UPI üáÆüá≥ team, where I gained valuable experience in digital payment systems. Afterward, I contributed to the Collections Operations (COPS) team, enhancing my skills in financial operations and loan recovery collections management. Currently, I am part of the Core Banking Systems üè¶ team, where I am involved in developing and optimizing banking solutions that drive the backbone of our bank financial services.
