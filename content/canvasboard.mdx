## From Bweb to Canvasboard: A Journey of Growth and Community Impact

When I first started working on what would eventually become Canvasboard, it wasn’t even called Canvasboard. 
Back then, it was simply known as Bweb ( Board on web ), a project I built for IIIT Bangalore. 
The idea for Bweb arose from the common frustration shared by every student in maintaining and accessing professor notes after class. 
It was tedious to keep track of everything, and during exams, it became a real challenge.


## The Birth of Bweb: Solving a Real Problem

Bweb was designed to solve this problem. It was a simple yet powerful web application that automatically synced 
professor notes into its database after each class, allowing students to easily access the material 
whenever they needed it. This solution made our lives as students much easier, especially during 
exam season when the pressure was on, and every piece of information counted. Bweb was a tool born out 
of necessity, created to address a very specific pain point.

What started as a small project within the confines of a college campus quickly became something more. 
My peers at IIIT Bangalore saw the value in Bweb, and its popularity began to grow. 
But at this stage, Bweb was still very much a niche tool, designed with a specific audience in mind. 
I hadn’t yet realized the potential that lay within this project.

## The Shift to Canvasboard: A Pandemic-Inspired Transformation

The world changed dramatically in 2020 with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
As the virus spread, everything shifted online—including education. schools, colleges, and universities around the globe had to adapt to a new reality almost overnight. 
This sudden shift exposed a glaring problem: the tools available for online education were fragmented, disjointed, and often inadequate for the new demands being placed on them. 
Teachers and students were struggling to juggle multiple platforms just to keep classes going. The need for a unified, easy-to-use platform became painfully apparent.

The real turning point came when my friend [Risikesh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rkrisi/) asked an intriguing question: “Why don’t you make this project open source and help more people during this pandemic?” 
This suggestion was a game-changer. Up until that point, Bweb had been a solution to a specific problem within a specific context. 
But the pandemic created a much larger problem—a problem that Bweb, or rather an evolved version of it, could help solve on a much larger scale.

That’s when I started thinking about the project in a new light. I rebranded Bweb as Canvasboard and began expanding its scope. 
Canvasboard wasn’t just about note-taking anymore; it was evolving into a comprehensive, all-in-one interactive board.

The first step in this new direction was to share Canvasboard with my 9th-grade tuition teacher. She loved it and saw its potential.
Encouraged by her feedback, I introduced Canvasboard to my school, and from there, it began to spread organically.

In the first six months alone, Canvasboard was utilized by over 50 educational organizations and gained more than 45,000 registered users.
Canvasboard helped bridge the gap in online education, providing a solution when it was needed most. 
This organic growth was incredible to witness, but it didn’t happen without effort.
I have cold messaged many teachers and I took feedback regularly from the teachers who were using Canvasboard and created gitHub issues. This wasn’t just my project anymore; it was becoming a collaborative effort. 
My friends [Navaneeth](https://www.linkedin.com/in/navaneeth-nidadavolu/) and [Akash](https://www.linkedin.com/in/akashmrc98/) helped in making the backend more robust, ensuring that Canvasboard could handle the growing number of users and the increasing complexity of its features. [Sai Kiran](https://www.linkedin.com/in/saikiran-reddy/) played crucial role on making the frontend user-friendly, incorporating interactive packages and innovative ideas to enhance the user experience. 
As time went on, more and more contributors joined us, each bringing their unique skills and perspectives to the project. Canvasboard began to take on a life of its own.


## Recognition and Growth

The recognition that Canvasboard received along the way was both humbling and affirming. 
From being showcased at major tech events like Open Source India and the Bengaluru Tech Summit to receiving acknowledgment from the Education Minister of Telangana, 
it was clear that Canvasboard was making an impact. These accolades were a testament to the hard work and dedication of everyone involved in the project.

## The Acquisition
As Canvasboard continued to grow and evolve, it caught the attention of larger organizations. 
The platform’s unique combination of functionality, user-friendliness, and community-driven development made it an attractive proposition. 
After much consideration and many discussions, Canvasboard was successfully acquired. It was a bittersweet moment. On one hand, I was proud of what we had built—Canvasboard had grown from a small college project into a platform that was making a real difference in the world. 


## Looking Back
Reflecting on this journey, I’m reminded that great things often start from small beginnings. 
Canvasboard began as a college side project, and then later, it’s a thriving open-source platform. 
It’s a testament to what can happen when you combine passion, community, and a bit of serendipity. 


I’m incredibly grateful to everyone who has been a part of this journey—contributors, 
users, and supporters. Together, we’ve built something impactful!
